## Welcome to Classified-ads-48 

Bringing to the web the idea of [classified advertising](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Classified_advertising). Together with rich input forms and an [interactive map](https://leafletjs.com/), we hope to create a digital platform that scales for different categories (sections) and for a large load of accessing users. All with a simple navigation, [minimal subscription](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Passwordless_authentication) and respecting user privacy.

This page presents the web-app technical aspects for possible *contribution* and *deployment*.

### Classified-ads-48 and Classified-ads-xx 

[Classified-ads-48](https://github.com/bacloud14/Classified-ads-48) would be the code base of a fully functional website that I (personally) want to deploy in Algeria. This means that it is specific to my case. Nevertheless, the repository is supposed to be fully customizable. You could with little configuration change the geo-location and served messages for all web-pages. All with different languages also.
