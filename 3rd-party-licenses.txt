   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

The Node.js's missing `keep alive` `http.Agent`. Support `http` and `https`.

## What's different from original `http.Agent`?

- `keepAlive=true` by default
- Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)`
- Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue.
- Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install agentkeepalive --save
```

## new Agent([options])

* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.
  Can have the following fields:
  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by
    other requests in the future. Default = `true`.
  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay
    for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.
    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout
    after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.
    Default is `15000`.
    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout
    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.
    Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.
  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per
    host. Default = `Infinity`.
  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open
    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
    Default = `256`.
  * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.
    If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)
    Default = `null`.

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');

const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10,
  timeout: 60000,
  freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds
});

const options = {
  host: 'cnodejs.org',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = http.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});
req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {
    console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
  }
}, 2000);

```

### `getter agent.statusChanged`

counters have change or not after last checkpoint.

### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`

`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:

```js
{
  createSocketCount: 10,
  closeSocketCount: 5,
  timeoutSocketCount: 0,
  requestCount: 5,
  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },
  sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },
  requests: {}
}
```

### Support `https`

```js
const https = require('https');
const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;

const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();
// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
const options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
}, 2000);
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - amp@0.3.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# amp

  Abstract Message Protocol codec and streaming parser for nodejs.

## Installation

```
$ npm install amp
```

## Example

```js
var bin = amp.encode([new Buffer('hello'), new Buffer('world')]);
var msg = amp.decode(bin);
console.log(msg);
```

## Protocol

  AMP is a simple versioned protocol for framed messages containing
  zero or more "arguments". Each argument is opaque binary, thus you
  may use JSON, BSON, msgpack and others on top of AMP. Multiple argument
  support is used to allow a hybrid of binary/non-binary message args without
  requiring higher level serialization libraries like msgpack or BSON.

  All multi-byte integers are big endian. The `version` and `argc` integers
  are stored in the first byte, followed by a sequence of zero or more
  `<length>` / `<data>` pairs, where `length` is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

```
      0        1 2 3 4     <length>    ...
+------------+----------+------------+
| <ver/argc> | <length> | <data>     | additional arguments
+------------+----------+------------+

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The Artistic License 2.0

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
Package available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
a different licensing arrangement.

Definitions

    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
    procedures.

    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
    distribute, or modify the Package.

    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
    Version, or a Modified Version.

    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
    by the Copyright Holder.

    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
    Holder.

    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
    configuration files for the Package.

    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
    translation of the Source form.


Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.


Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
Compiled form of the Package.

(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
will be subject to the Original License.


Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
you do at least ONE of the following:

    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
    Version.

    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
    from the name of the Standard Version.

    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
    under

        (i)  the Original License or

        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
        Fees are allowed.


Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
or Modified Versions without the Source

(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
the Source of the Modified Version.


Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.


Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
terms of this license.


General Provisions

(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
license.

(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
this license.

(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
date that such litigation is filed.

(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - boolbase@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - bs58@4.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

bs58
====

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/cryptocoinjs/bs58.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cryptocoinjs/bs58)

JavaScript component to compute base 58 encoding. This encoding is typically used for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin.

**Note:** If you're looking for **base 58 check** encoding, see: [https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bs58check](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bs58check), which depends upon this library.


Install
-------

    npm i --save bs58


API
---

### encode(input)

`input` must be a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) or an `Array`. It returns a `string`.

**example**:

```js
const bs58 = require('bs58')

const bytes = Buffer.from('003c176e659bea0f29a3e9bf7880c112b1b31b4dc826268187', 'hex')
const address = bs58.encode(bytes)
console.log(address)
// => 16UjcYNBG9GTK4uq2f7yYEbuifqCzoLMGS
```


### decode(input)

`input` must be a base 58 encoded string. Returns a [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html).

**example**:

```js
const bs58 = require('bs58')

const address = '16UjcYNBG9GTK4uq2f7yYEbuifqCzoLMGS'
const bytes = bs58.decode(address)
console.log(out.toString('hex'))
// => 003c176e659bea0f29a3e9bf7880c112b1b31b4dc826268187
```

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer From

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.from`, uses native implementation if available.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-from
```

## Usage

```js
const bufferFrom = require('buffer-from')

console.log(bufferFrom([1, 2, 3, 4]))
//=> <Buffer 01 02 03 04>

const arr = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
console.log(bufferFrom(arr.buffer, 1, 2))
//=> <Buffer 02 03>

console.log(bufferFrom('test', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 74 65 73 74>

const buf = bufferFrom('test')
console.log(bufferFrom(buf))
//=> <Buffer 74 65 73 74>
```

## API

### bufferFrom(array)

- `array` &lt;Array&gt;

Allocates a new `Buffer` using an `array` of octets.

### bufferFrom(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])

- `arrayBuffer` &lt;ArrayBuffer&gt; The `.buffer` property of a TypedArray or ArrayBuffer
- `byteOffset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start copying from `arrayBuffer`. **Default:** `0`
- `length` &lt;Integer&gt; How many bytes to copy from `arrayBuffer`. **Default:** `arrayBuffer.length - byteOffset`

When passed a reference to the `.buffer` property of a TypedArray instance, the
newly created `Buffer` will share the same allocated memory as the TypedArray.

The optional `byteOffset` and `length` arguments specify a memory range within
the `arrayBuffer` that will be shared by the `Buffer`.

### bufferFrom(buffer)

- `buffer` &lt;Buffer&gt; An existing `Buffer` to copy data from

Copies the passed `buffer` data onto a new `Buffer` instance.

### bufferFrom(string[, encoding])

- `string` &lt;String&gt; A string to encode.
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; The encoding of `string`. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Creates a new `Buffer` containing the given JavaScript string `string`. If
provided, the `encoding` parameter identifies the character encoding of
`string`.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - charm@0.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

charm
=====

Use
[ansi terminal characters](http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm)
to write colors and cursor positions.

![me lucky charms](http://substack.net/images/charms.png)

example
=======

lucky
-----

````javascript
var charm = require('charm')();
charm.pipe(process.stdout);
charm.reset();

var colors = [ 'red', 'cyan', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue' ];
var text = 'Always after me lucky charms.';

var offset = 0;
var iv = setInterval(function () {
    var y = 0, dy = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
        var color = colors[(i + offset) % colors.length];
        var c = text[(i + offset) % text.length];
        charm
            .move(1, dy)
            .foreground(color)
            .write(c)
        ;
        y += dy;
        if (y <= 0 || y >= 5) dy *= -1;
    }
    charm.position(0, 1);
    offset ++;
}, 150);
````

events
======

Charm objects pass along the data events from their input stream except for
events generated from querying the terminal device.

Because charm puts stdin into raw mode, charm emits two special events: "^C" and
"^D" when the user types those combos. It's super convenient with these events
to do:

````javascript
charm.on('^C', process.exit)
````

The above is set on all `charm` streams. If you want to add your own handling for these
special events simply:

````javascript
charm.removeAllListeners('^C')
charm.on('^C', function () {
  // Don't exit. Do some mad science instead.
})
````

methods
=======

var charm = require('charm')(param or stream, ...)
--------------------------------------------------

Create a new readable/writable `charm` stream.

You can pass in readable or writable streams as parameters and they will be
piped to or from accordingly. You can also pass `process` in which case
`process.stdin` and `process.stdout` will be used.

You can `pipe()` to and from the `charm` object you get back.

charm.reset()
-------------

Reset the entire screen, like the /usr/bin/reset command.

charm.destroy(), charm.end()
----------------------------

Emit an `"end"` event downstream.

charm.write(msg)

charm.position(x, y)
--------------------

Set the cursor position to the absolute coordinates `x, y`.

charm.position(cb)
------------------

Query the absolute cursor position from the input stream through the output
stream (the shell does this automatically) and get the response back as
`cb(x, y)`.

charm.move(x, y)
----------------

Move the cursor position by the relative coordinates `x, y`.

charm.up(y)
-----------

Move the cursor up by `y` rows.

charm.down(y)
-------------

Move the cursor down by `y` rows.

charm.left(x)
-------------

Move the cursor left by `x` columns.

charm.right(x)
--------------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - classified-ads-48@0.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Classified-ads-48 

Bringing to the web the idea of classified advertising. Together with rich input forms and an interactive map, we hope to create a digital platform that scales for different categories (sections) and for a large load of accessing users. All with a simple navigation, minimal subscription and respecting user privacy.

## Inspired from newspapers

> Newspaper classifieds  
Advertisements in a newspaper are typically short, as they are charged for by the line or word, and are one newspaper column wide.  
Publications printing news or other information often have sections of classified advertisements; there are also publications that contain only advertisements. The advertisements are grouped into categories or classes such as "for sale—telephones", "wanted—kitchen appliances", and "services—plumbing", hence the term "classified". Classified ads generally fall into two types: individuals advertising sales of their personal goods, and advertisements by local businesses. Some businesses use classified ads to hire new employees. [link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising)

--------

In **Classified-ads-48** however (this repository), users can post in the following sections:

- Donations (main section of the website)
- Skills 
- Articles: DIY, How-Tos, passions, passtimes and hobbies

and the map that I chose is *Algeria*. 

The purpose of this project is to let forkers implement new sections and offer the wep-app for other geo-locations.

**Classified-ads-48** utilizes many front and back-end libraries to offer a rich set of form, users can post HTML styled articles with pictures.

**Classified-ads-48** respects user privacy and offers a passwordless login.

**Classified-ads-48** acts like a Man In the Middle to offer messaging between users. Without a heavy messaging system like internal messages box. It rather let users use their respective emails.

## JavaScript libraries and credits

**Classified-ads-48** utilizes **a lot** of beautiful and effective libraries besides server npm packages, these are the libraries and snippets used for front-end (descriptions from their respective repositories):

 - pell: the simplest and smallest WYSIWYG text editor for web, with no dependencies [repo](https://github.com/jaredreich/pell)
 - tagify: lightweight, efficient Tags input component in Vanilla JS / React / Angular / Vue [repo](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify)
 - toasty: A minimal JavaScript notification plugin that provides a simple way to display customizable toast messages on the web page with CSS3 transition effects. [repo](https://github.com/egalink/Toasty.js)
 - holmes: Fast and easy searching inside a page [repo](https://github.com/Haroenv/holmes) It uses microlight also.
 - auto-complete:  An extremely lightweight and powerful vanilla JavaScript completion suggester. [repo](https://github.com/Pixabay/JavaScript-autoComplete)
 - jsi18n: Simple client side internationalization with javascript. [repo](https://github.com/danabr/jsI18n)

## Database

MongoDB using the official MongoDB Node Driver

## Style

It is inteded to be clean, fast and paper/newspaper looking style and layout.


**Data model is really simplistic. I only used one table (or collection in NoSQL jargon).**

## Routes 

**Note**  
We use *Listings/listing* term as a designation of *posts/post*.

Routes reflect what is possible. See https://github.com/bacloud14/Classified-ads-48/blob/main/routes/listings.js 
Otherwise, this is the list of routes (queries and views):

  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings -> listings.ejs : is for showing some of listings. Also to initiate the following post queries
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/{section} -> listings.ejs : is for showing some of listings. but for some section
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/gwoogl -> listings.ejs : for search of listings
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/add_donation -> listing.ejs : for adding a listing
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/add_skill -> listing.ejs : for adding a listing
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/deactivate -> messages.ejs : to deactivate a listing
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/{some_id} -> listing.ejs : to show a listing of some id
  - <ins>domain</ins>/ -> index.ejs : shows map & exposts all other routes (contact, tags, listings, ...)
  - <ins>domain</ins>/{some_tag} -> listings.ejs : to show all listings about one tag
  - <ins>domain</ins>/{some_division} -> listings.ejs : to show all listings for some geo delimitation
  - <ins>domain</ins>/listings/tags -> tags.ejs : for exposing contant list of possible tags
  - <ins>domain</ins>/contact -> messages.ejs : for user messaging 
  - <ins>domain</ins>/game -> game.ejs : a map connected with sockets to send data back and forth between browser and server and broadcast data to all users

  - /sessions  (empty file)  
  - .env (check bellow *)
  - /client/dist  (empty folder)  
  - /client/.env (check bellow **)
  - Check [tree file](tree.txt)
- Create MongoDB databases: `listings_db_dev` and `listings_db` with both collections `listing` and `words`
- `cd client` then `npm install`
- Go back to root folder to `npm install` then `npm run prestart`

## Classified-ads-48 for *Algeria* use case

I want to build an open annoucements platform in *Algeria* (Lack of an online serious posting platform. I feel Facebook and others alone are so diverse but a separate specialized platform with a map can be a good case).

## Captures

- Index page shows fresh listings

![Index page](GITHUB/docs/Capture_index.PNG)

- Section page shows listings of type donations, skills or blogs

![Section page](GITHUB/docs/Capture_section.PNG)

- Add a listing, depending on secrtion type, show or hide map

![Add a listing](GITHUB/docs/Capture_add.PNG)

- Get a listing

## Contribution

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - cyclist@0.2.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Cyclist

Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript.
It is available through npm

	npm install cyclist

## What?

Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic.
In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one.
This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data
packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.

## Usage

``` js
var cyclist = require('cyclist');
var list = cyclist(4); // if size (4) is not a power of 2 it will be the follwing power of 2
                       // this buffer can now hold 4 elements in total

list.put(42, 'hello 42'); // store something and index 42
list.put(43, 'hello 43'); // store something and index 43

console.log(list.get(42)); // prints hello 42
console.log(list.get(46)); // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size
```

## API

* `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer
* `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer
* `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer
* `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index
* `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer

This package contains the following license and notice below:

data-uri-to-buffer
==================
### Generate a Buffer instance from a [Data URI][rfc] string
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer)

This module accepts a ["data" URI][rfc] String of data, and returns a
node.js `Buffer` instance with the decoded data.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install data-uri-to-buffer
```


Example
-------

``` js
var dataUriToBuffer = require('data-uri-to-buffer');

// plain-text data is supported
var uri = 'data:,Hello%2C%20World!';
var decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'

// base64-encoded data is supported
uri = 'data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D';
decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'
```


API
---

### dataUriToBuffer(String uri) → Buffer

The `type` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the main type portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"text/plain"` if not
specified.

The `typeFull` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the entire
"mediatype" portion of the "data" URI (including all parameters), or defaults
to `"text/plain;charset=US-ASCII"` if not specified.

The `charset` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Charset portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"US-ASCII"` if the
entire type is not specified, or defaults to `""` otherwise.

*Note*: If the only the main type is specified but not the charset, e.g.
`"data:text/plain,abc"`, the charset is set to the empty string. The spec only
defaults to US-ASCII as charset if the entire type is not specified.

degenerator
===========
### Compiles sync functions into async functions
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood.
This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and
returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into `async`
functions.

So this:

```js
function foo() {
  return a('bar') || b();
}
```

Gets compiled into:

```js
async function foo() {
    return await a('bar') || await b();
}
```

With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module
in Node.js, or save the code to a file and require it, or whatever.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install degenerator
```


Example
-------

You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be
"asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did
and HTTP request and returned the response body.

The user has provided us with this implementation:

``` js
function myFn() {
  const one = get('https://google.com');
  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');
  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));
  return [one, two, three];
}
```

Now we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the
async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function
instance with the `vm` module:


```typescript
import vm from 'vm';
import degenerator from 'degenerator';

// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)
function get(endpoint: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');
    var req = mod.get(endpoint);
    req.on('response', function (res) {
      var data = '';
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });
      res.on('end', function () {
        resolve(data);
      });
    });
  });
}

// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)
str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);

// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance
const asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });

// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously
asyncFn().then((res) => {
  // Do something with `res`...
});
```


API
---

### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>, options?: DegeneratorOptions): String

Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.

#### DegeneratorOptions

An options object _may_ be passed in as the third parameter, with the following
values:

 * `output` - string - May be `"async"` or `"generator"`, defaults to `"async"`.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - emitter-listener@1.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## Add dynamic instrumentation to emitters

`shimmer` does a bunch of the work necessary to wrap other methods in
a wrapper you provide:

```javascript
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var wrapEmitter = require('emitter-listener');

var ee = new EventEmitter();

var id = 0;

wrapEmitter(
  ee,
  function mark(listener) {
    listener.id = id++;
  },
  function prepare(listener) {
    console.log('listener id is %d', listener.id);
  }
);
```

### Mandatory disclaimer

There are times when it's necessary to monkeypatch default behavior in
JavaScript and Node. However, changing the behavior of the runtime on the fly
is rarely a good idea, and you should be using this module because you need to,
not because it seems like fun.

#### wrapEmitter(emitter, mark, prepare)

Wrap an EventEmitter's event listeners. Each listener will be passed to
`mark` when it is registered with `.addListener()` or `.on()`, and then
each listener is passed to `prepare` to be wrapped before it's called
by the `.emit()` call. `wrapListener` deals with the single listener
vs array of listeners logic, and also ensures that edge cases like
`.removeListener()` being called from within an `.emit()` for the same
event type is handled properly.

The wrapped EE can be restored to its pristine state by using
emitter.__unwrap(), but this should only be used if you *really* know
what you're doing.

[david-dm-dev-image]:https://img.shields.io/david/dev/IndigoUnited/js-err-code.svg

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

`$ npm install err-code` - `NPM`   
`$ bower install err-code` - `bower`

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });


// You may also pass a string in the first argument and an error will be automatically created
// for you, though the stack trace will contain err-code in it.

// create error with message + code
throw errcode('My message', 'ESOMECODE');
// create error with message + code + props
throw errcode('My message', 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// create error with message + props
throw errcode('My message', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```


## Tests

`$ npm test`

## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[![build-status](https://www.codeship.io/projects/3ad58940-4c7d-0131-15d5-5a8cd3f550f8/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/11259)

# SYNOPSIS

EventEmitter2 is an implementation of the EventEmitter found in Node.js

# DESCRIPTION

### FEATURES
 - Namespaces/Wildcards.
 - Times To Listen (TTL), extends the `once` concept with `many`.
 - Browser environment compatibility.
 - Demonstrates good performance in benchmarks

```
EventEmitterHeatUp x 3,728,965 ops/sec \302\2610.68% (60 runs sampled)
EventEmitter x 2,822,904 ops/sec \302\2610.74% (63 runs sampled)
EventEmitter2 x 7,251,227 ops/sec \302\2610.55% (58 runs sampled)
EventEmitter2 (wild) x 3,220,268 ops/sec \302\2610.44% (65 runs sampled)
Fastest is EventEmitter2
```

### Differences (Non breaking, compatible with existing EventEmitter)

 - The constructor takes a configuration object.
 
```javascript
    var EventEmitter2 = require('eventemitter2').EventEmitter2;
    var server = new EventEmitter2({

      //
      // use wildcards.
      //
      wildcard: true,

      //
      // the delimiter used to segment namespaces, defaults to `.`.
      //
      delimiter: '::', 
      
      //
      // if you want to emit the newListener event set to true.
      //
      newListener: false, 

      //
      // max listeners that can be assigned to an event, default 10.
      //
      maxListeners: 20
    });
```

 - Getting the actual event that fired.

```javascript
    server.on('foo.*', function(value1, value2) {
      console.log(this.event, value1, value2);
    });
```

 - Fire an event N times and then remove it, an extension of the `once` concept.

```javascript
    server.many('foo', 4, function() {
      console.log('hello');
    });
```

 - Pass in a namespaced event as an array rather than a delimited string.

```javascript
    server.many(['foo', 'bar', 'bazz'], function() {
      console.log('hello');
    });
```


# API

When an `EventEmitter` instance experiences an error, the typical action is
to emit an `error` event. Error events are treated as a special case.
If there is no listener for it, then the default action is to print a stack
trace and exit the program.

All EventEmitters emit the event `newListener` when new listeners are
added.


**Namespaces** with **Wildcards**
To use namespaces/wildcards, pass the `wildcard` option into the EventEmitter 
constructor. When namespaces/wildcards are enabled, events can either be 
strings (`foo.bar`) separated by a delimiter or arrays (`['foo', 'bar']`). The 
delimiter is also configurable as a constructor option.

An event name passed to any event emitter method can contain a wild card (the 
`*` character). If the event name is a string, a wildcard may appear as `foo.*`. 
If the event name is an array, the wildcard may appear as `['foo', '*']`.

If either of the above described events were passed to the `on` method, 
subsequent emits such as the following would be observed...

```javascript
   emitter.emit('foo.bazz');
   emitter.emit(['foo', 'bar']);
```


### emitter.addListener(event, listener)
### emitter.on(event, listener)

Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value1, value2, value3, ...) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

```javascript
    server.on('data', function(value) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

### emitter.onAny(listener)

Adds a listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.

```javascript
    server.onAny(function(value) {
      console.log('All events trigger this.');
    });
```

### emitter.offAny(listener)

Removes the listener that will be fired when any event is emitted.

```javascript
    server.offAny(function(value) {
      console.log('The event was raised!');
    });
```

#### emitter.once(event, listener)

Adds a **one time** listener for the event. The listener is invoked 
only the first time the event is fired, after which it is removed.

```javascript
    server.once('get', function (value) {
      console.log('Ah, we have our first value!');
    });
```

### emitter.many(event, timesToListen, listener)

Adds a listener that will execute **n times** for the event before being
removed. The listener is invoked only the first **n times** the event is 
fired, after which it is removed.

```javascript
    server.many('get', 4, function (value) {
      console.log('This event will be listened to exactly four times.');
    });
```


### emitter.removeListener(event, listener)
### emitter.off(event, listener)

Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event. 
**Caution**: changes array indices in the listener array behind the listener.

```javascript
    var callback = function(value) {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('get', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('get', callback);
```


### emitter.removeAllListeners([event])

Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event.


### emitter.setMaxListeners(n)

By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners 
are added to it. This is a useful default which helps finding memory leaks. 
Obviously not all Emitters should be limited to 10. This function allows 
that to be increased. Set to zero for unlimited.


### emitter.listeners(event)

Returns an array of listeners for the specified event. This array can be 
manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.

```javascript
    server.on('get', function(value) {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(server.listeners('get')); // [ [Function] ]
```

### emitter.listenersAny()

Returns an array of listeners that are listening for any event that is 
specified. This array can be manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.

```javascript
    server.onAny(function(value) {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(server.listenersAny()[0]); // [ [Function] ]
```

### emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...])

Execute each of the listeners that may be listening for the specified event 
name in order with the list of arguments.

Simple plug & play HTTP basic auth middleware for Express.

## How to install

Just run

```shell
npm install express-basic-auth
```

## How to use

The module will export a function, that you can call with an options object to
get the middleware:

```js
const app = require('express')()
const basicAuth = require('express-basic-auth')

app.use(basicAuth({
    users: { 'admin': 'supersecret' }
}))
```

The middleware will now check incoming requests to match the credentials
`admin:supersecret`.

The middleware will check incoming requests for a basic auth (`Authorization`)
header, parse it and check if the credentials are legit. If there are any
credentials, an `auth` property will be added to the request, containing
an object with `user` and `password` properties, filled with the credentials,
no matter if they are legit or not.

**If a request is found to not be authorized**, it will respond with HTTP 401
and a configurable body (default empty).

### Static Users

If you simply want to check basic auth against one or multiple static credentials,
you can pass those credentials in the `users` option:

```js
app.use(basicAuth({
    users: {
        'admin': 'supersecret',
        'adam': 'password1234',
        'eve': 'asdfghjkl',
    }
}))
```

The middleware will check incoming requests to have a basic auth header matching
one of the three passed credentials.

### Custom authorization

Alternatively, you can pass your own `authorizer` function, to check the credentials
however you want. It will be called with a username and password and is expected to
return `true` or `false` to indicate that the credentials were approved or not.

When using your own `authorizer`, make sure **not to use standard string comparison (`==` / `===`)**
when comparing user input with secret credentials, as that would make you vulnerable against
[timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack). Use the provided `safeCompare`
function instead - always provide the user input as its first argument. Also make sure to use bitwise
logic operators (`|` and `&`) instead of the standard ones (`||` and `&&`) for the same reason, as
the standard ones use shortcuts.

```js
app.use(basicAuth( { authorizer: myAuthorizer } ))

function myAuthorizer(username, password) {
    const userMatches = basicAuth.safeCompare(username, 'customuser')
    const passwordMatches = basicAuth.safeCompare(password, 'custompassword')

    return userMatches & passwordMatches
}
```

This will authorize all requests with the credentials 'customuser:custompassword'.
In an actual application you would likely look up some data instead ;-) You can do whatever you
want in custom authorizers, just return `true` or `false` in the end and stay aware of timing
attacks.

### Custom Async Authorization

Note that the `authorizer` function above is expected to be synchronous. This is
the default behavior, you can pass `authorizeAsync: true` in the options object to indicate
that your authorizer is asynchronous. In this case it will be passed a callback
as the third parameter, which is expected to be called by standard node convention
with an error and a boolean to indicate if the credentials have been approved or not.
Let's look at the same authorizer again, but this time asynchronous:

```js
app.use(basicAuth({
    authorizer: myAsyncAuthorizer,
    authorizeAsync: true,
}))

function myAsyncAuthorizer(username, password, cb) {
    if (username.startsWith('A') & password.startsWith('secret'))
        return cb(null, true)
    else
        return cb(null, false)
}
```

### Unauthorized Response Body

Per default, the response body for unauthorized responses will be empty. It can
be configured using the `unauthorizedResponse` option. You can either pass a
static response or a function that gets passed the express request object and is
expected to return the response body. If the response body is a string, it will
be used as-is, otherwise it will be sent as JSON:

```js
app.use(basicAuth({
    users: { 'Foo': 'bar' },
    unauthorizedResponse: getUnauthorizedResponse
}))

function getUnauthorizedResponse(req) {
    return req.auth
        ? ('Credentials ' + req.auth.user + ':' + req.auth.password + ' rejected')
        : 'No credentials provided'
}
```

### Challenge

Per default the middleware will not add a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header to
responses of unauthorized requests. You can enable that by adding `challenge: true`
to the options object. This will cause most browsers to show a popup to enter
credentials on unauthorized responses. You can set the realm (the realm
identifies the system to authenticate against and can be used by clients to save
credentials) of the challenge by passing a static string or a function that gets
passed the request object and is expected to return the challenge:

```js
app.use(basicAuth({
    users: { 'someuser': 'somepassword' },
    challenge: true,
    realm: 'Imb4T3st4pp',
}))
```

## Try it

The repository contains an `example.js` that you can run to play around and try
the middleware. To use it just put it somewhere (or leave it where it is), run

```shell
npm install express express-basic-auth
node example.js
```

This will start a small express server listening at port 8080. Just look at the file,
try out the requests and play around with the options.

## TypeScript usage

A declaration file is bundled with the library. You don't have to install a `@types/` package.

```typescript
import * as basicAuth from 'express-basic-auth'
```

:bulb: **Using `req.auth`**

express-basic-auth sets `req.auth` to an object containing the authorized credentials like `{ user: 'admin', password: 'supersecret' }`.

In order to use that `req.auth` property in TypeScript without an unknown property error, use covariance to downcast the request type:

```typescript
app.use(basicAuth(options), (req: basicAuth.IBasicAuthedRequest, res, next) => {
    res.end(`Welcome ${req.auth.user} (your password is ${req.auth.password})`)
    next()
})
```

:bulb: **A note about type inference on synchronous authorizers**

Due to some TypeScript's type-system limitation, the arguments' type of the synchronous authorizers are not inferred.
For example, on an asynchronous authorizer, the three arguments are correctly inferred:

```typescript
basicAuth({
    authorizeAsync: true,
    authorizer: (user, password, authorize) => authorize(null, password == 'secret'),
})
```

However, on a synchronous authorizer, you'll have to type the arguments yourself:

```typescript
basicAuth({
    authorizer: (user: string, password: string) => (password == 'secret')
})
```

## Tests

The cases in the `example.js` are also used for automated testing. So if you want  
to contribute or just make sure that the package still works, simply run:

```shell
npm test
```

# Express Slow Down

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down)
[![NPM version](http://badge.fury.io/js/express-slow-down.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/express-slow-down "View this project on NPM")
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down.png?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down)
[![Development Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down/dev-status.png?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/nfriedly/express-slow-down#info=devDependencies)

Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express that slows down responses rather than blocking them outright. Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.

Plays nice with [Express Rate Limit](https://npmjs.org/package/express-rate-limit)

Note: this module does not share state with other processes/servers by default. This module was extracted from Express Rate Limit 2.x and can work with it's stores:

### Stores

- Memory Store _(default, built-in)_ - stores hits in-memory in the Node.js process. Does not share state with other servers or processes.
- [Redis Store](https://npmjs.com/package/rate-limit-redis)
- [Memcached Store](https://npmjs.org/package/rate-limit-memcached)

Note: when using express-slow-down and express-rate-limit with an external store, you'll need to create two instances of the store and provide different prefixes so that they don't double-count requests.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save express-slow-down
```

## Usage

For an API-only server where the rules should be applied to all requests:

```js
const slowDown = require("express-slow-down");

app.enable("trust proxy"); // only if you're behind a reverse proxy (Heroku, Bluemix, AWS if you use an ELB, custom Nginx setup, etc)

const speedLimiter = slowDown({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  delayAfter: 100, // allow 100 requests per 15 minutes, then...
  delayMs: 500 // begin adding 500ms of delay per request above 100:
  // request # 101 is delayed by  500ms
  // request # 102 is delayed by 1000ms
  // request # 103 is delayed by 1500ms
  // etc.
});

//  apply to all requests
app.use(speedLimiter);
```

For a "regular" web server (e.g. anything that uses `express.static()`), where the rate-limiter should only apply to certain requests:

```js
const slowDown = require("express-slow-down");

app.enable("trust proxy"); // only if you're behind a reverse proxy (Heroku, Bluemix, AWS if you use an ELB, custom Nginx setup, etc)

const resetPasswordSpeedLimiter = slowDown({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  delayAfter: 5, // allow 5 requests to go at full-speed, then...
  delayMs: 100 // 6th request has a 100ms delay, 7th has a 200ms delay, 8th gets 300ms, etc.
});

// only apply to POST requests to /reset-password/
app.post("/reset-password/", resetPasswordSpeedLimiter, function(req, res) {
  // handle /reset-password/ request here...
});
```

## `req.slowDown`

A `req.slowDown` property is added to all requests with the following fields:

- `limit`: The options.delayAfter value (defaults to 1)
- `current`: The number of requests in the current window
- `remaining`: The number of requests remaining before rate-limiting begins
- `resetTime`: When the window will reset and current will return to 0, and remaining will return to limit (in milliseconds since epoch - compare to Date.now()). Note: this field depends on store support. It will be undefined if the store does not provide the value.
- `delay`: Amount of delay imposed on current request (milliseconds)

## Configuration

- **windowMs**: milliseconds - how long to keep records of requests in memory. Defaults to `60000` (1 minute).
- **delayAfter**: max number of connections during `windowMs` before starting to delay responses. Number or function that returns a number. Defaults to `1`. Set to `0` to disable delaying.
- **delayMs**: milliseconds - how long to delay the response, multiplied by (number of recent hits - `delayAfter`). Defaults to `1000` (1 second). Set to `0` to disable delaying.
- **maxDelayMs**: milliseconds - maximum value for `delayMs` after many consecutive attempts, that is, after the n-th request, the delay will be always `maxDelayMs`. Important when your application is running behind a load balancer or reverse proxy that has a request timeout. Defaults to `Infinity`.

  ```javascript
  // Example

  // Given:
  {
      delayAfter: 1,
      delayMs: 1000,
      maxDelayMs: 20000,
  }

  // Results will be:
  // 1st request - no delay
  // 2nd request - 1000ms delay
  // 3rd request - 2000ms delay
  // 4th request - 3000ms delay
  // ...
  // 20th request - 19000ms delay
  // 21st request - 20000ms delay
  // 22nd request - 20000ms delay
  // 23rd request - 20000ms delay
  // 24th request - 20000ms delay <-- will not increase past 20000ms
  // ...
  ```

- **skipFailedRequests**: when `true` failed requests (response status >= 400) won't be counted. Defaults to `false`.
- **skipSuccessfulRequests**: when `true` successful requests (response status < 400) won't be counted. Defaults to `false`.
- **keyGenerator**: Function used to generate keys. By default user IP address (req.ip) is used. Defaults:

  ```js
  function (req /*, res*/) {
      return req.ip;
  }
  ```

- **skip**: Function used to skip requests. Returning true from the function will skip limiting for that request. Defaults:

  ```js
  function (/*req, res*/) {
      return false;
  }
  ```

- **onLimitReached**: Function to listen the first time the limit is reached within windowMs. Defaults:

  ```js
  function (req, res, options) {
  /* empty */
  }
  ```

- **store**: The storage to use when persisting rate limit attempts. By default, the [MemoryStore](lib/memory-store.js) is used.
  - Note: when using express-slow-down and express-rate-limit with an external store, you'll need to create two instances of the store and provide different prefixes so that they don't double-count requests.
- **headers**: Add `X-SlowDown-Limit`, `X-SlowDown-Remaining`, and if the store supports it, `X-SlowDown-Reset` headers to all responses. Modeled after the equivalent headers in express-rate-limit. Default: `false`

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - filelist@1.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## FileList

A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list
of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file
list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,
a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.

This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of
files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList
itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an
element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns
are resolved into a real list of file names.

### Usage

Add files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob
patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array
methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to
an actual list of files.

```javascript
var fl = new FileList();
fl.include('test/*.js');
fl.exclude('test/helpers.js');
```

Use the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this
when your inclusions are too broad.

### Array methods

FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array
methods, including the following:

* join
* pop
* push
* concat
* reverse
* shift
* unshift
* slice
* splice
* sort
* filter
* forEach
* some
* every
* map
* indexOf
* lastIndexOf
* reduce
* reduceRight

When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList
will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will
be invoked on that result.

### Special `length` method

`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a
property) which returns the number of actual files in the list
once it's been resolved.

### FileList-specific methods

`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list

`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex

`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of
files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array
methods is called.

`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an
actual array of filepaths.

`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used
before resolving the list.

`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - geocluster@0.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# geocluster

`geocluster` finds clusters in sets of coordinates. It's a port of [S-means](https://www.npmjs.org/package/smeans) by [Brian Hann](https://www.npmjs.org/~c0bra) (which itself is a [stdev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)-driven form of [K-means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means)), but with two dimensions, Earth-[geodesic distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid) and properly working code.

## Install

```
npm install geocluster
```

## API

### result = geocluster(coordinates[, bias])

`coordinates` is an Array of `[lat, lon]` pairs.
`bias` is a factor the standard deviation gets multiplied with, which acts as threshold to determine if a coordinate belongs to a cluster.

`result` is an Array of cluster objects, which have `centroid` and `elements` properties. Example:

``` javascript
[{
	centroid: [1.0,1.0],
	elements: [
		[1.0,1.0], [0.9,1.1], [1.1,0.9]
	]
},{
	centroid: [2.0,2.0],
	elements: [
		[2.0,2.0], [1.9,2.1], [2.1,1.9]
	]
}]
``` 

## Sample Code

``` javascript

var geocluster = require("geocluster");

var coordinates = [ // array of lat-lon-pairs
	[<lat>, <lon>], 
	[<lat>, <lon>], 
	[<lat>, <lon>],
	// ...
];

var bias = 1.5; // multiply stdev with this factor, the smaller the more clusters

var result = geocluster(coordinates, bias); 

// result is an array of cluster objects with `centroid` and `elements` properties

```

### Returns a `stream.Readable` from a URI string
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This high-level module accepts a URI string and returns a `Readable` stream
instance. There is built-in support for a variety of "protocols", and it's
easily extensible with more:

| Protocol  | Description                     | Example
|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:
| `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D`
| `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini`
| `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README`
| `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name`
| `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install get-uri
```


Example
-------

To simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:

``` js
var getUri = require('get-uri');

// `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance…
getUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) throw err;
  rs.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```


Missing Endpoints
-----------------

When you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the
destination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the
error instance is set to `"ENOTFOUND"`, so you can special-case that in your code
to detect when a bad filename is requested:

``` js
getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) {
    if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {
      // bad file path requested
    } else {
      // something else bad happened...
      throw err;
    }
  }

  // your app code…
});
```


Cacheability
------------

When calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module
supports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified
since the last time it has been retreived from that node process.

To do this, pass in a `cache` option to the "options object" argument
with the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously
returned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for
that same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's
`code` property set to `"ENOTMODIFIED"`.

When the `"ENOTMODIFIED"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the
results from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:

``` js
// maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance
getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {
  if (err) throw err;

  // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the
  // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially
  // receive an "ENOTMODIFIED" response:
  var opts = { cache: rs };
  getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {
    if (err) {
      if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {
        // bad file path requested
      } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {
        // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,
        // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from
        // a previous call to `getUri()`
      } else {
        // something else bad happened...
        throw err;
      }
    }
  });
});
```


API
---

### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)

A `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:

 - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned

Any other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through
to the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`,
etc).

Invokes the given `callback` function with a `stream.Readable` instance to
read the resource at the given `uri`.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Can I cache this? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics)

`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches. It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.

## Usage

Cacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.

```js
const policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);

if (!policy.storable()) {
    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all
    return;
}

// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache
// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))
letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(request.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());
```

```js
// And later, when you receive a new request:
const {policy, response} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:
if (policy && policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.
    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

It may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.

The key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.

### Constructor options

Request and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).

```js
const request = {
    url: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: '*/*',
    },
};

const response = {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',
    },
};

const options = {
    shared: true,
    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,
    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24*3600*1000, // 24h
    ignoreCargoCult: false,
};
```

If `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored).

`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100*0.1 = 10 days.

`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.

If `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's "session limiter" defaults.

### `storable()`

Returns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.

### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`

This is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.

If it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.

If it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).

### `responseHeaders()`

Returns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.

```js
cachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);
```

### `timeToLive()`

Returns approximate time in *milliseconds* until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).

After that time (when `timeToLive() <= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.

### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`

Chances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.

### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)

When a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.

The following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.

#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`

Returns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.

Use this method when updating cache from the origin server.

```js
updateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);
```

#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`

Use this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:

* `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.
* `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.
   * If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body.
   * If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.

```js
// When serving requests from cache:
const {oldPolicy, oldResponse} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

if (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used
    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);

    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304
    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newResponse);

    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data
    const {policy, modified} = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(newRequest, newResponse);
    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;

    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response
    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(newRequest.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());

    // And proceed returning cached response as usual
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

Lazy lists for node
===================


# Table of contents:

# Introduction
Lazy comes really handy when you need to treat a stream of events like a list.
The best use case currently is returning a lazy list from an asynchronous
function, and having data pumped into it via events. In asynchronous
programming you can't just return a regular list because you don't yet have
data for it. The usual solution so far has been to provide a callback that gets
called when the data is available. But doing it this way you lose the power of
chaining functions and creating pipes, which leads to not that nice interfaces.
(See the 2nd example below to see how it improved the interface in one of my
modules.)

Check out this toy example, first you create a Lazy object:
```javascript
    var Lazy = require('lazy');

    var lazy = new Lazy;
    lazy
      .filter(function (item) {
        return item % 2 == 0
      })
      .take(5)
      .map(function (item) {
        return item*2;
      })
      .join(function (xs) {
        console.log(xs);
      });
```

This code says that 'lazy' is going to be a lazy list that filters even
numbers, takes first five of them, then multiplies all of them by 2, and then
calls the join function (think of join as in threads) on the final list.

And now you can emit 'data' events with data in them at some point later,
```javascript
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].forEach(function (x) {
      lazy.emit('data', x);
    });
```

The output will be produced by the 'join' function, which will output the
expected [0, 4, 8, 12, 16].

And here is a real-world example. Some time ago I wrote a hash database for
node.js called node-supermarket (think of key-value store except greater). Now
it had a similar interface as a list, you could .forEach on the stored
elements, .filter them, etc. But being asynchronous in nature it lead to the
following code, littered with callbacks and temporary lists:
```javascript
    var Store = require('supermarket');

    var db = new Store({ filename : 'users.db', json : true });

    var users_over_20 = [];
    db.filter(
      function (user, meta) {
        // predicate function
        return meta.age > 20;
      },
      function (err, user, meta) {
        // function that gets executed when predicate is true
        if (users_over_20.length < 5)
          users_over_20.push(meta);
      },
      function () {
        // done function, called when all records have been filtered

        // now do something with users_over_20
      }
    )
```
This code selects first five users who are over 20 years old and stores them
in users_over_20.

But now we changed the node-supermarket interface to return lazy lists, and
the code became:
```javascript
    var Store = require('supermarket');

    var db = new Store({ filename : 'users.db', json : true });

    db.filter(function (user, meta) {
        return meta.age > 20;
      })
      .take(5)
      .join(function (xs) {
        // xs contains the first 5 users who are over 20!
      });
```
This is so much nicer!

Here is the latest feature: .lines. Given a stream of data that has \n's in it,
.lines converts that into a list of lines.

Here is an example from node-iptables that I wrote the other week,
```javascript
    var Lazy = require('lazy');
    var spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
    var iptables = spawn('iptables', ['-L', '-n', '-v']);

    Lazy(iptables.stdout)
        .lines
        .map(String)
        .skip(2) // skips the two lines that are iptables header
        .map(function (line) {
            // packets, bytes, target, pro, opt, in, out, src, dst, opts
            var fields = line.trim().split(/\s+/, 9);
            return {
                parsed : {
                    packets : fields[0],
                    bytes : fields[1],
                    target : fields[2],
                    protocol : fields[3],
                    opt : fields[4],
                    in : fields[5],
                    out : fields[6],
                    src : fields[7],
                    dst : fields[8]
                },
                raw : line.trim()
            };
        });
```
This example takes the `iptables -L -n -v` command and uses .lines on its output.
Then it .skip's two lines from input and maps a function on all other lines that
creates a data structure from the output.

<a name="Documentation" />
# Documentation

Supports the following operations:

* lazy.filter(f)
* lazy.forEach(f)
* lazy.map(f)
* lazy.take(n)
* lazy.takeWhile(f)
* lazy.bucket(init, f)
* lazy.lines
* lazy.sum(f)
* lazy.product(f)
* lazy.foldr(op, i, f)
* lazy.skip(n)
* lazy.head(f)
* lazy.tail(f)
* lazy.join(f)

The Lazy object itself has a .range property for generating all the possible ranges.

Here are several examples:

* Lazy.range('10..') - infinite range starting from 10
* Lazy.range('(10..') - infinite range starting from 11
* Lazy.range(10) - range from 0 to 9
* Lazy.range(-10, 10) - range from -10 to 9 (-10, -9, ... 0, 1, ... 9)
* Lazy.range(-10, 10, 2) - range from -10 to 8, skipping every 2nd element (-10, -8, ... 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
* Lazy.range(10, 0, 2) - reverse range from 10 to 1, skipping every 2nd element (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)
* Lazy.range(10, 0) - reverse range from 10 to 1
* Lazy.range('5..50') - range from 5 to 49
* Lazy.range('50..44') - range from 50 to 45
* Lazy.range('1,1.1..4') - range from 1 to 4 with increment of 0.1 (1, 1.1, 1.2, ... 3.9)
* Lazy.range('4,3.9..1') - reverse range from 4 to 1 with decerement of 0.1
* Lazy.range('[1..10]') - range from 1 to 10 (all inclusive)
* Lazy.range('[10..1]') - range from 10 to 1 (all inclusive)
* Lazy.range('[1..10)') - range grom 1 to 9
* Lazy.range('[10..1)') - range from 10 to 2
* Lazy.range('(1..10]') - range from 2 to 10
* Lazy.range('(10..1]') - range from 9 to 1
* Lazy.range('(1..10)') - range from 2 to 9
* Lazy.range('[5,10..50]') - range from 5 to 50 with a step of 5 (all inclusive)

Then you can use other lazy functions on these ranges.

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - netmask@2.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Netmask
=======

The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.

Synopsis
--------

```js
var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask

var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');
block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0
block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0
block.bitmask;                  // 12
block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255
block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255
block.size;                     // 1048576
block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1
block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254

block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true
block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true
block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false

block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));

block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')
```

Constructing
------------

Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:

```
'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.
'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00
'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.
'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form
'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form
```

API
---

- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address
- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.
- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.
- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')

Installation
------------

    $ npm install netmask

Run all tests (vows plus mocha)
-------------------------------

    $ npm test

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - node-forge@0.10.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - optional-require@1.0.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]
[![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] [![devDependency Status][daviddm-dev-image]][daviddm-dev-url]

# Optional Require

NodeJS Require that let you handle module not found error without try/catch.  Allows you to gracefully require a module only if it exists and contains no error.

# Usage

```js
const optionalRequire = require("optional-require")(require);

const foo = optionalRequire("foo") || {};
const bar = optionalRequire("bar", true); // true enables console.log a message when not found
const xyz = optionalRequire("xyz", "test"); // "test" enables console.log a message with "test" added.
const fbPath = optionalRequire.resolve("foo", "foo doesn't exist");
const rel = optionalRequire("../foo/bar"); // relative module path works
```

# Install

```bash
$ npm i optional-require --save
```

# API

#### [optionalRequire(require)](#optionalrequirerequire)

The single function this module exports.  Call it with `require` to get a custom function for you to do optional require from your file's require context.  See [Usage](#usage) above.

#### [customOptionalRequire(path, \[message|options\])](#customoptionalrequirepath-messageoptions)

The function [optionalRequire](#optionalrequirerequire) returns for you to do optional require from your file's require context.

##### Params

-   `path` - name/path to the module your want to optionally require
-   `message` - optional flag/message to enable `console.log` a message when module is not found
-   `options` - an optional object with the following fields
    -   `message` - see above
    -   `fail` - callback for when an error that's _not_ `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `path` occurred
    -   `notFound` - callback for when `path` was not found
        -   The value from this is returned
    -   `default` - default value to returned when not found - not allowed with `notFound` together

##### Returns

-   module required or one of the following if not found
    -   `undefined` or
    -   return value from `options.notFound` if it's specified
    -   `options.default` if it's specified

##### Throws

-   rethrows any error that's not `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for the module `path`

#### [customOptionalRequire.resolve(path, \[message\])](#customoptionalrequireresolvepath-message)

Same as [customOptionalRequire](#customoptionalrequirepath-messageoptions) but acts like `require.resolve`

pac-proxy-agent
===============
### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or
SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the
HTTP endpoint.

It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install pac-proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var PacProxyAgent = require('pac-proxy-agent');

// URI to a PAC proxy file to use (the "pac+" prefix is stripped)
var proxy = 'pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+';
console.log('using PAC proxy proxy file at %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `PacProxyAgent` class with the PAC file location
var agent = new PacProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - pac-resolver@4.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

pac-resolver
============
### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia]
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/actions?workflow=Node+CI)


This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous
`FindProxyForURL()` function.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install pac-resolver
```


Example
-------

Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:

```js
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {
    return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";
  } else {
    return "DIRECT";
  }
}
```

You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var pac = require('pac-resolver');

var FindProxyForURL = pac(fs.readFileSync('proxy.pac'));

FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/').then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
  // "DIRECT"
});
```


API
---

### pac(String pacFileContents[, Object options]) → Function

Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS
string `pacFileContents` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be
passed in which respects the following options:

 * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.
 * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the
 JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to
 include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For
 async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function
 instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were
 synchronous.

# axon-rpc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Unitech/pm2-axon-rpc.png)](https://travis-ci.org/unitech/pm2-axon-rpc)

  RPC client / server for [axon](https://github.com/visionmedia/axon).

## arpc(1)

  The `arpc(1)` executable allows you to expose entire
  node modules with a single command, or inspect
  methods exposed by a given node.

```

Usage: arpc [options] <module>

Options:

  -h, --help            output usage information
  -V, --version         output the version number
  -a, --addr <addr>     bind to the given <addr>
  -m, --methods <addr>  inspect methods exposed by <addr>

```

## Server

```js
var rpc = require('axon-rpc')
  , axon = require('axon')
  , rep = axon.socket('rep');

var server = new rpc.Server(rep);
rep.bind(4000);
```

### Server#expose(name, fn)

  Expose a single method `name` mapped to `fn` callback.

```js
server.expose('add', function(a, b, fn){
  fn(null, a + b);
});
```

### Server#expose(object)

  Expose several methods:

```js
server.expose({
  add: function(){ ... },
  sub: function(){ ... }
});
```

  This may also be used to expose
  an entire node module with exports:

```js
server.expose(require('./api'));
```

## Client

```js
var rpc = require('axon-rpc')
  , axon = require('axon')
  , req = axon.socket('req');

var client = new rpc.Client(req);
req.connect(4000);
```

### Client#call(name, ..., fn)

  Invoke method `name` with some arguments and invoke `fn(err, ...)`:

```js
client.call('add', 1, 2, function(err, n){
  console.log(n);
  // => 3
})
```

### Client#methods(fn)

  Request available methods:

```js
client.methods(function(err, methods){
  console.log(methods);
})
```

  Responds with objects such as:

```js
{
  add: {
    name: 'add',
    params: ['a', 'b', 'fn']
  }
}
```

example
=======

````javascript
var multimeter = require('multimeter');
var multi = multimeter(process);

multi.drop(function (bar) {
    var iv = setInterval(function () {
        var p = bar.percent();
        bar.percent(p + 1);
        
        if (p >= 100) clearInterval(iv);
    }, 25);
});
````

methods
=======

var multimeter = require('multimeter');

var multi = multimeter(stream, ...)
-----------------------------------

Create a new multimeter handle on the supplied stream/process objects, which
will be passed directly to [charm](https://github.com/substack/node-charm).

If you pass in a charm object that will be used instead of creating a new one.

var bar = multi(x, y, params)
-----------------------------

Create a new progress bar at `(x,y)` with `params` which default to:

* width : 10
* before : '['
* after : '] '
* solid : { background : 'blue', foreground : 'white', text : '|' }
* empty : { background : null, foreground : null, text : ' ' }

If `y` is negative or `'-0'` it will be treated as a relative coordinate.

var bar = multi.rel(x, y, params)
---------------------------------

Create a new progress bar at an absolute `x` and relative `y` coordinate with
respect to the present `multi.offset`.

multi.drop(params, cb)
----------------------

Create a new progress bar at the present cursor location. The `bar` object will
be passed to `cb(bar)` once the cursor location has been determined. 

multi.on(...), multi.removeListener(...), multi.destroy(...), multi.write(...)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call event emitter functions on the underlying `charm` object.

multi.offset
------------

This getter/setter controls the positioning for relative progress bars.

Increment this value whenever you write a newline to the stream to prevent the
pending progress bars from drifting down from their original positions.

bar.percent(p, msg=p + ' %')
----------------------------

Update the progress bar to `p` percent, a value between 0 and 100, inclusive.

The text to the right of the progress bar will be set to `msg`.

bar.ratio(n, d, msg=n + ' / ' + d)
----------------------------------

Update the progress bar with a ratio, `n/d`.

The text to the right of the progress bar will be set to `msg`.

attributes
==========

multi.charm
-----------

The [charm](https://github.com/substack/node-charm) object used internally to
draw the progress bars.

install
=======

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

    npm install multimeter

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

The quantization and dithering code in pngquant is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's
'ppmquant', part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.

Greg Roelofs hacked it into a (in his words) "slightly cheesy" 'pamquant' back
in 1997 (see http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally he ripped out
the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in December
2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly simplified
version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from his book "PNG: The Definitive
Guide."
In 2014 Greg has relicensed the code under the simplified BSD license.

Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the code however
you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.

===========
### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent)

This module provides a function that returns proxying `http.Agent` instances to
use based off of a given proxy URI. If no URI is provided, then
[proxy-from-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) is used to get the URI
from `$HTTP_PROXY`, `$HTTPS_PROXY` and `$NO_PROXY` among others.

An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for
subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:


| Protocol   | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example
|:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------:
| `http`     | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128`
| `https`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129`
| `socks(v5)`| [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks5`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks4`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050`
| `pac`      | [pac-proxy-agent][]             | [pac-proxy-agent][]              | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var http = require('http');
var ProxyAgent = require('proxy-agent');

// HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use
var proxyUri = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';

var opts = {
  method: 'GET',
  host: 'jsonip.org',
  path: '/',
  // this is the important part!
  // If no proxyUri is specified, then https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env
  // is used to get the proxyUri.
  agent: new ProxyAgent(proxyUri)
};

// the rest works just like any other normal HTTP request
http.get(opts, onresponse);

function onresponse (res) {
  console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
}
```


API
---

### new ProxyAgent(Object|String opts|uri)

Returns an `http.Agent` instance based off of the given proxy `opts` or URI
string. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be
returned if identical args are passed in.

`psl` is a `JavaScript` domain name parser based on the
[Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).

This implementation is tested against the
[test data hosted by Mozilla](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/test/unit/data/test_psl.txt?raw=1)
and kindly provided by [Comodo](https://www.comodo.com/).


## What is the Public Suffix List?

The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate list
of domain name suffixes.

The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is
maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software,
but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers.

A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can directly register names.
Some examples of public suffixes are ".com", ".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us". The
Public Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.

and include it in a script tag.

```html
<script src="psl.min.js"></script>
```

This script is browserified and wrapped in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)
wrapper so you should be able to use it standalone or together with a module
loader.

## API

### `psl.parse(domain)`

Parse domain based on Public Suffix List. Returns an `Object` with the following
properties:

* `tld`: Top level domain (this is the _public suffix_).
* `sld`: Second level domain (the first private part of the domain name).
* `domain`: The domain name is the `sld` + `tld`.
* `subdomain`: Optional parts left of the domain.

#### Example:

```js
var psl = require('psl');

// Parse domain without subdomain
var parsed = psl.parse('google.com');
console.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'
console.log(parsed.sld); // 'google'
console.log(parsed.domain); // 'google.com'
console.log(parsed.subdomain); // null

// Parse domain with subdomain
var parsed = psl.parse('www.google.com');
console.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'
console.log(parsed.sld); // 'google'
console.log(parsed.domain); // 'google.com'
console.log(parsed.subdomain); // 'www'

// Parse domain with nested subdomains
var parsed = psl.parse('a.b.c.d.foo.com');
console.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'
console.log(parsed.sld); // 'foo'
console.log(parsed.domain); // 'foo.com'
console.log(parsed.subdomain); // 'a.b.c.d'
```

### `psl.get(domain)`

Get domain name, `sld` + `tld`. Returns `null` if not valid.

#### Example:

```js
var psl = require('psl');

// null input.
psl.get(null); // null

// Mixed case.
psl.get('COM'); // null
psl.get('example.COM'); // 'example.com'
psl.get('WwW.example.COM'); // 'example.com'

// Unlisted TLD.
psl.get('example'); // null
psl.get('example.example'); // 'example.example'
psl.get('b.example.example'); // 'example.example'
psl.get('a.b.example.example'); // 'example.example'

// TLD with only 1 rule.
psl.get('biz'); // null
psl.get('domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'
psl.get('b.domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'
psl.get('a.b.domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'

// TLD with some 2-level rules.
psl.get('uk.com'); // null);
psl.get('example.uk.com'); // 'example.uk.com');
psl.get('b.example.uk.com'); // 'example.uk.com');

// More complex TLD.
psl.get('c.kobe.jp'); // null
psl.get('b.c.kobe.jp'); // 'b.c.kobe.jp'
psl.get('a.b.c.kobe.jp'); // 'b.c.kobe.jp'
psl.get('city.kobe.jp'); // 'city.kobe.jp'
psl.get('www.city.kobe.jp'); // 'city.kobe.jp'

// IDN labels.
psl.get('食狮.com.cn'); // '食狮.com.cn'
psl.get('食狮.公司.cn'); // '食狮.公司.cn'
psl.get('www.食狮.公司.cn'); // '食狮.公司.cn'

// Same as above, but punycoded.
psl.get('xn--85x722f.com.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.com.cn'
psl.get('xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'
psl.get('www.xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'
```

### `psl.isValid(domain)`

Check whether a domain has a valid Public Suffix. Returns a `Boolean` indicating
whether the domain has a valid Public Suffix.

#### Example

```js
var psl = require('psl');

psl.isValid('google.com'); // true
psl.isValid('www.google.com'); // true
psl.isValid('x.yz'); // false
```


## Testing and Building

Test are written using [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/) and can be
run in two different environments: `node` and `phantomjs`.

```sh
# This will run `eslint`, `mocha` and `karma`.
npm test

# Individual test environments
# Run tests in node only.
./node_modules/.bin/mocha test
# Run tests in phantomjs only.
./node_modules/.bin/karma start ./karma.conf.js --single-run

# Build data (parse raw list) and create dist files
npm run build
```

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - run-queue@1.0.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
or `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `http` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - stable@0.1.8

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## Stable

A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.

MIT licensed.

[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)

[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)

#### From npm

Install with:

```sh
npm install stable
```

Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:

```js
const stable = require('stable')
```

#### From the browser

Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
in your page, then call `stable()`.

 [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
 [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:

```js
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5]
```

Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:

```js
const arr = [10, 1, 5]
stable(arr) === arr          // => false
stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true
```

A comparator function can be specified:

```js
// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
// This demonstrates the default behavior.
const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']

// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b
stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - stream-events@1.0.5

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# stream-events

> Get an event when you're being sent data or asked for it.

## About

This is just a simple thing that tells you when `_read` and `_write` have been called, saving you the trouble of writing this yourself. You receive two events `reading` and `writing`-- no magic is performed.

This works well with [duplexify](https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify) or lazy streams, so you can wait until you know you're being used as a stream to do something asynchronous, such as fetching an API token.


## Use
```sh
$ npm install --save stream-events
```
```js
var stream = require('stream')
var streamEvents = require('stream-events')
var util = require('util')

function MyStream() {
  stream.Duplex.call(this)
  streamEvents.call(this)
}
util.inherits(MyStream, stream.Duplex)

MyStream.prototype._read = function(chunk) {
  console.log('_read called as usual')
  this.push(new Buffer(chunk))
  this.push(null)
}

MyStream.prototype._write = function() {
  console.log('_write called as usual')
}

var stream = new MyStream

stream.on('reading', function() {
  console.log('stream is being asked for data')
})

stream.on('writing', function() {
  console.log('stream is being sent data')
})

stream.pipe(stream)
```

### Using with Duplexify
```js
var duplexify = require('duplexify')
var streamEvents = require('stream-events')
var fs = require('fs')

var dup = streamEvents(duplexify())

dup.on('writing', function() {
  // do something async
  dup.setWritable(/*writable stream*/)
})

fs.createReadStream('file').pipe(dup)
```

 - stubs@3.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# stubs

> It's a simple stubber.

## About

For when you don't want to write the same thing over and over to cache a method and call an override, then revert it, and blah blah.


## Use
```sh
$ npm install --save-dev stubs
```
```js
var mylib = require('./lib/index.js')
var stubs = require('stubs')

// make it a noop
stubs(mylib, 'create')

// stub it out
stubs(mylib, 'create', function() {
  // calls this instead
})

// stub it out, but call the original first
stubs(mylib, 'create', { callthrough: true }, function() {
  // call original method, then call this
})

// use the stub for a while, then revert
stubs(mylib, 'create', { calls: 3 }, function() {
  // call this 3 times, then use the original method
})
```


## API

### stubs(object, method[[, opts], stub])

#### object
- Type: Object

#### method
- Type: String

Name of the method to stub.

#### opts
- (optional)
- Type: Object

##### opts.callthrough

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    5. Time Zone Database

      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
    Database section 7.

     # 7.  Database Ownership
     #
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

    The Artistic License 2.0

    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
    Package available as open source and free software.

    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
    a different licensing arrangement.

    Definitions

        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
        procedures.

        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
        distribute, or modify the Package.

        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
        Version, or a Modified Version.

        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
        by the Copyright Holder.

        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
        Holder.

        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
        configuration files for the Package.

        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
        translation of the Source form.

    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
    Compiled form of the Package.

    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
    will be subject to the Original License.

    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
    you do at least ONE of the following:

        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
        Version.

        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
        from the name of the Standard Version.

        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
        under

            (i)  the Original License or

            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
            Fees are allowed.

    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
    or Modified Versions without the Source

    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
    the Source of the Modified Version.

    Aggregating or Linking the Package

    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
    as included in the aggregation.

    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
    terms of this license.

    General Provisions

    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
    license.

    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
    this license.

    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
    date that such litigation is filed.

    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - xregexp@2.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/)
==============================

XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.

XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.


## Performance

XRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.


## Usage examples

~~~ js
// Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments)
var date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \n\
                    (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \n\
                    (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');

// XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result
var match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date);
match.day; // -> '22'

// It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments
var pos = 3, result = [];
while (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {
    result.push(match[1]);
    pos = match.index + match[0].length;
} // result -> ['2', '3', '4']

// XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'
XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {
    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;
}); // -> '02/22/2012'

// In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods
date.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true

// The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'

// If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this
// Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods
XRegExp.install('natives');
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'
'2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {
    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;
}); // -> '02/22/2012'
date.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'

// Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach
XRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\d/, function (match, i) {
    if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]);
}, []); // -> [2, 4]

// Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain
XRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [
    XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),
    /\d+/
]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']

// You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences
var html = '<a href="http://xregexp.com/">XRegExp</a>\
            <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>';
XRegExp.matchChain(html, [
    {regex: /<a href="([^"]+)">/i, backref: 1},
    {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'}
]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']

// XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern
XRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\1/, /(cats)\1/], 'i');
// -> /a\+b\*c|(dogs)\1|(cats)\2/i
~~~

These examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.


## Addons

In browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.


### XRegExp Unicode Base

In browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/unicode/unicode-base.js"></script>
~~~

Then you can do this:

~~~ js
var unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\p{L}+$');
unicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true
unicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true
unicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true
~~~

The base script adds `\p{Letter}` and its alias `\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:

~~~ js
XRegExp('^\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true
XRegExp('^[\\p{Latin}\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true
~~~

XRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.


### XRegExp.build

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/build.js"></script>
~~~

You can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:

~~~ js
var time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {
    hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {
        h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,
        h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/
    }, 'x'),
    minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/
});

time.test('10:59'); // -> true
XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'
~~~

Named subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.

See also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.


### XRegExp.matchRecursive

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/matchrecursive.js"></script>
~~~

You can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:

~~~ js
var str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)';
XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\(', '\\)', 'g');
// -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']

`XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.


### XRegExp Prototype Methods

In browsers, first include the script:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp.js"></script>
<script src="addons/prototypes.js"></script>
~~~

New XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.

~~~ js
// To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using...
function filter(array, fn) {
    var res = [];
    array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});
    return res;
}
// Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes
filter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab']
~~~

Native `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:

~~~ js
XRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc');
XRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc');
XRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc');
~~~


## Installation and usage

In browsers:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp-min.js"></script>
~~~

Or, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:

~~~ html
<script src="xregexp-all-min.js"></script>
~~~

Using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

~~~ bash
npm install xregexp
~~~

In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:

~~~ js
var XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp;
~~~


### Running tests on the server with npm

~~~ bash
npm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests
npm test  # in the xregexp root
~~~

If XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.


## &c

**Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.
